		<div class="q">	
	Why did you choose graphic design?
		</div>

		<div class="a">
	I chose graphic design because I had a passion for art and the creativity since my school days, I was always making art in my classes and I wanted to make it digital. So this interest in art turned into a hobby to learn how to make my designs digital and soon it became my passion and the job that I would love to pursue in my future. I wanted to learn more about graphic design and wanted to refine my skills, learn from the basics to all the way upto the advanced aspects of graphic design.

		<div class="q">	
	What's the most challenging part of being a graphic designer to you?
		</div>

		<div class="a">
	The most challenging part of being a graphic designer to me is staying creative all the time. Sometimes, I would look at a design brief and nothing will come up to my mind that how I want to proceed with the design. I have now learned from experience that you don't need a perfect design in your head to start from. You just have to start with something and eventually something will come to your mind that looks good. Graphic Design is a process and the perfect designs are made from continous revisions and changes and not in one go.

		<div class="q">	
	How did your interest began in graphic design?
		</div>

		<div class="a">
	My interest began in graphic design when I was still in school, I always used to make art in my classes and wanted to make them digitally. I started from there and then I came across a video on youtube that was a tutorial on how to make your own channel banner for youtube. That piqued my interest even more and I saw a wider opportunity and a whole industry that works on graphic design. I saw this as a potential job oppurtunity for the future and I had all the interest in art, Graphic Design was the right field for me.

		<div class="q">	
	What kind of job are you trying to pursue?
		</div>

		<div class="a">
	I would love to have a job as a Graphic Designer in the near future when I graduate. I would like to have a job at a graphic design studio that can help me in experience with different types of clients and businesses with different briefs and different styles for themselves which can help me in experiment in different art styles. Having a wide demographic of businesses and clients would help me in creative thinking for a brand and color schemes. I would also like to do freelance on the side to make my own identity in the market.

	<div class="section">
		<div class="q">	
	What are your strengths and weaknesses?
		</div>

		<div class="a">
	My strengths are I am very patient and creative and always priortise quality over the quantity. I would rather take a day extra to make the design look near perfect than just send a file to my client which is subpar and not upto the mark for me. My weaknesses are I lose motivation very quickly and sometimes prefering my own creative ideas over the clients. I think sometimes the client revisions would make the design look bad and instead try to have my own style on it. I make sure my designs are according to the client but it has my own style to it.

	<div class="section">
		<div class="q">	
	Where do you see yourself in the next few years?
		</div>

		<div class="a">
	For the short term, I see myself working in a graphic design studio as a graphic designer helping them in all their client designs and building my own brand identity on the side. For the long term, I would build my own brand identity for the clients, I would love to own a graphic design studio in the long term with my own set of talented creative individuals. I would like to add something to the creative market that has not been done before and is new to the market.
